The night breeze fluttered its frayed edges, the fragment trapped between her slender fingers—a lost butterfly. Her long hair left unwisely loose, chestnut strands billowed around her body, a soft veil threatening to tangle, never succeeding.</p></blockquote><p>As an amateur street photographer, I've been a longtime practitioner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive">dérive</a>, cultivating a habit of taking long, unplanned walks in whichever city I'm fortunate enough to find myself in. So when the invitation came from Todd Sanders of <a href="http://aanpress.com/">Air and Nothingness Press</a> to write a short story on the theme, I simply couldn't say no! </p><p>Like many of my Solarpunk stories, I want readers to be able to walk in a real city, follow the characters’ paths and imagine it as a different place. In the end, I settled on Melbourne, Australia, a very walkable city where I'd spent many, many hours wandering—just me, my camera and a battered notebook.</p><p><em>The Dérive</em> was edited by Todd Sanders and appears in a beautifully designed volume— complete with maps. Authors: Lyndsey Croal, Marie Croke, Cameron E Quinn, Ana Sun.</p><figure class="post__image align-center"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://singingtotigers.com/media/posts/19/derive.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="535" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://singingtotigers.com/media/posts/19/responsive/derive-xs.jpg 320w, https://singingtotigers.com/media/posts/19/responsive/derive-sm.jpg 480w, https://singingtotigers.com/media/posts/19/responsive/derive-md.jpg 768w, https://singingtotigers.com/media/posts/19/responsive/derive-xl.jpg 1024w"></figure><figcaption>"The Dérive" book cover by Todd Sanders</figcaption></figure><p><em>This story has been set on a location on the lands of the Wurundjeri people, and we wish to acknowledge them as Traditional Owners and custodians.
