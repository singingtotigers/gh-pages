<p>The Librarian Card Catalogue was borne from the idea that you could read stories about the Librarian's adventures through the multiverse in a random fashion: a deck of cards you could shuffle. It has to be the most beautiful publication I've had the fortune to participate in; every card has been uniquely designed to match the story. The bonus stamps and other ephemera are pretty special too. </p>
<p>This unique anthology was edited by the talented Todd Sanders, who also did all the art. Stories by: Brent Baldwin, Carina Bissett, Brandon Crilly, E J Delaney, Lindsey Godfrey Eccles, Gabriel Ertsgaard, Mary Goodden, Paula Hammond, Rebecca Hardy, J.D. Harlock, Jennifer Howell, Marshall J. Moore, Mike Morgan, Waverly X. Night, Cameron E Quinn, Maria Schrater, Elizabeth Snow, NA Sulway, Ana Sun, and LB Waltz. </p>

<p>Some mornings, when I step out my front door, two hundred feet above the forest floor between trees shimmering with dew, that moment—so long ago now—still catches me off guard, transfixing time to stillness. That moment: when Titi climbed into a tree just like these to retrieve a wayward drone. His scrawny frame, a speck high up in the canopy, lost in a sparkling sky of deep green, his skin as brown as the belian he was scaling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based in a town in the heart of Borneo, this story is perhaps the most personal I've written to date. I wanted to simultaneously explore the complexity of grief in friendship, the natural environment as well as within a post-colonial context.  </p>

<p>At the corner of The Causeway and Little Collins Street, she bent down and picked up a piece of broken heart that had fallen out of my pocket. The night breeze fluttered its frayed edges, the fragment trapped between her slender fingers—a lost butterfly. Her long hair left unwisely loose, chestnut strands billowed around her body, a soft veil threatening to tangle, never succeeding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an amateur street photographer, I've been a longtime practitioner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive">dérive</a>, cultivating a habit of taking long, unplanned walks in whichever city I'm fortunate enough to find myself in. So when the invitation came from Todd Sanders of <a href="http://aanpress.com/">Air and Nothingness Press</a> to write a short story on the theme, I simply couldn't say no! </p>
<p>Like many of my Solarpunk stories, I want readers to be able to walk in a real city, follow the characters’ paths and imagine it as a different place. In the end, I settled on Melbourne, Australia, a very walkable city where I'd spent many, many hours wandering—just me, my camera and a battered notebook.</p>
<p><em>The Dérive</em> was edited by Todd Sanders and appears in a beautifully designed volume— complete with maps. Authors: Lyndsey Croal, Marie Croke, Cameron E Quinn, Ana Sun.</p>

<p>There’s a pretty good chance you’ve come across the oft-quoted anecdote on how the Star Trek communicator inspired the flip phone. This is usually preceded or followed by an assertion: because of this, speculative fiction has a place; we should keep writing it because it has a genuine impact on the world. Turns out the second claim has support of some scientific evidence, but there’s more to the story...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes Solarpunk a genre, and why should we write it? How do positive visions of the future affect both scientists and citizens, designers and engineers? Can fiction highlight solutions to environmental dangers and social injustice? </p>
<p>After encountering many questions that my writing colleagues seem to have, I pooled knowledge from solarpunk communities I've inhabited over the years and penned this evidence-laden article as a (hopefully) handy reference.</p>

<p>One of my earliest attempts at writing Solarpunk, I wanted to examine the challenges of knowledge sharing if communities were autonomous, self-reliant but fragmented— ideas I borrowed from past experience in grassroots activism.</p>

<p>When Todd Sanders of <a href="http://aanpress.com/">Air and Nothing Press</a> made an open call for stories for <em>The Librarian </em>anthology, it came with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/52625019/the-librarian-1">an intriguing list of character guidelines</a>. This story took inspiration from a real library of things local to me, mashed up with ideas triggered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_Wife">a favourite Dr. Who episode</a>. </p>

                    Sometimes, the future hinges on a whisker of a moment, as if time were a wild animal. That weight in the air as seconds prowl past, I smell it on your breath as you curl and uncurl your fists— left, then right, then left again.

<p>I'm somewhat obsessed by how time wears all things down, including our relationships, commitments and promises to ourselves and to each other. “Against the Time Beasts” is the first of a set of tales where the title of each story corresponds to a line in a poem—examining time, entropy and the moments of minute deaths.</p>

<p>I turn around to prepare the infusions. Something catches my eye. A boat I’ve never seen before slithers into the Serpentine. Unlike mine, its cockpit is covered, presumably connected to the main cabin. The small deck on the bow looks like an afterthought. There are no windows— it’s all black. It has no running lights, surely a safety hazard if you ask me. It’s ugly and fascinating the way oil slicks are. </p>

<p>To adapt to our changing climate and overcome challenges, we are going to need everything across the gamut of human knowledge, skills and technology. Too often, I've witnessed people taking sides in believing that their evidence is the only version of truth — whether it's empiricism or folk knowledge — to the extent that we would reject each others' perspectives without listening to each other, because we are blinded by prejudice. Writing "Dandelion Brew" was my way of exploring the relationship between technology and lore, and to play out a tiny slice of this conflict and examine how we might find common ground, and that seeing the world differently, together garners a collective strength.</p>
