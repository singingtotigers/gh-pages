Something catches my eye. A boat I’ve never seen before slithers into the Serpentine. Unlike mine, its cockpit is covered, presumably connected to the main cabin.

Too often, I've witnessed people taking sides in believing that their evidence is the only version of truth — whether it's empiricism or folk knowledge — to the extent that we would reject each others' perspectives without listening to each other, because we are blinded by prejudice. Writing "Dandelion Brew" was my way of exploring the relationship between technology and lore, and to play out a tiny slice of this conflict and examine how we might find common ground, and that seeing the world differently, together garners a collective strength.</p><p class="align-right"><a href="https://dreamforge.mywebportal.app/dreamforge/stories/show/dandelion-brew-ana-sun" title="Read 'Dandelion Brew' for free on Dreamforge" class="btn">Free to read →</a></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><div class="footer-content"><p class="footer-bio">Ana Sun (pronounced “Soon”) writes from the edge of an ancient town along the River Ouse in the south-east of England.
