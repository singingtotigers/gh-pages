Machines hummed a low, unwavering note. The fishes native to our waters—loaches, prawns, tilapia, koi—didn’t seem to mind. On top of the aquaria, ten thousand tiny spears of young rice plants stood solemn in their sobriety, a field of unfettered green.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Soul Noodles\" reimagines the Asian city I was born in as a Solarpunk locale. Food has always been central to our identity and culture. In this story, I wanted to explore: what happens if the ingredients core to our most significant recipes are no longer available?</p>\n<p>This anthology was edited by Francesco Verso and copy-edited by Eileen Herbert-Goodall.
